# spidey-sense

SpideySense is our team's project for HackMIT. We use a Bangle.js 2 watch to measure biometrics and feed it to an XGBoost model which predicts fear. Then, an AI agent calls the police for you. We use Twilio's API for TTS/STT and a Llama-3.1 instance deployed on Baseten for intelligent response.
